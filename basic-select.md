| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N |  NUMBER |

# **[Weather Observation Station 4](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-4/problem)**

Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
The STATION table is described as follows:

|  Field | Type |
|---|---|
| ID  | NUMBER |

For example, if there are three records in the table with CITY values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. The query returns , because
total number of records - number of unique city names = 3-2=1

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT (COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT(CITY)))
FROM STATION;       
```
# **[Weather Observation Station 5](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5/problem)**

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

|  Field | Type |
|---|---|
| ID  | NUMBER |
| CITY | VARCHAR2(21)   |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N |  NUMBER |
| LONG_W | NUMBER |

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

*Sample Input*

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

*Sample Output*

ABC 3 

PQRS 4

*Explanation*

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths 3,3,4,3,3,4, and 33. The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are 33 options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

*Note*

You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

**Solution**
```sql
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) 
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) 
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1;    
```

# **[Type of Triangle](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/what-type-of-triangle/problem))**

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

|  Column | Type |
|---|---|
| A | INTEGER |
| B | INTEGER  |
| C | INTEGER  |

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input

|  A | B | C |
|---|---|----|
| 20  | 20 | 23 | 
| 20  | 20 | 20 |
| 20  | 21 | 22 |
| 13  | 14 | 30 |

Sample Output

```Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
```

Explanation

- Values in the tuple (20, 20, 23) form an Isosceles triangle, because A = B.
- Values in the tuple (20, 20, 20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A = B = C. 
- Values in the tuple (20, 21, 22) form a Scalene triangle, because A != B != C.
- Values in the tuple (13, 14, 30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.

Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR A = C OR B = C THEN 'Isosceles'
        WHEN A <> B and B <> C THEN 'Scalene'
    END tuple
FROM TRIANGLES;
```
